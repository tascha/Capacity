These can include challenges in all aspects of capacity, including space, technology acquisition, technology use, staff, and partnerships. Our goal in this section is to make troubleshooting capacity challenges at your library accessible, so you can feel confident in your library’s capacity to provide connected learning infused programs.

Here is a broad list of common capacity challenges:

*   Small library
*   Low technology budget
*   Low acquisitions budget
*   Small volunteer group
*   Minimal teen attendance
