Libraries are a center of their communities. Your library might often host community events, perform outreach to different parts of your community (for example schools and/or daycares), or play a key role in community fundraising. Libraries are built to provide for their communities, and many libraries have different ways to determine community need. Some libraries host “town hall” style events to hear from their communities, while others might use online surveys. Knowing the needs of your community is likely something your library has already been working on. However, understanding the needs of your community in relation to your library’s unique capacity can help to strengthen an already strong system.

In our module on Community Mapping, we delve deeply into how to assess the assets and strengths of your community and develop a community map. Here, we will be covering the subject from a slightly different angle. We will be taking stock of resources your community already has, as identified in Community Mapping, and how these strengths can be leveraged to help supplement your library’s capacity. Our Community Mapping module can helps us survey the landscape, and we can use what we know to inform our library’s capacity and act on our findings.

**Community Assets**

Community assets can be as broad as entire organizations, or as specific as individuals. In this module, assets will be very similar to those conceptualized in the Community Mapping module. Here, they are framed in terms of their relation to your library’s capacity. The University of Kansas in their online Community Tool Box defines an asset as “anything that can be used to improve the quality of community life.” For our purposes today, we will define assets as follows:

**Individuals** are the backbone of communities. Often, your library might have individuals that volunteer to shelve books or organize “friends of the library” fundraising events. There might be a stay-at-home dad who organizes playgroups, or a retired bus driver that bakes large batches of her family’s famous cookies. Individuals in our communities are diverse in their strengths, and can help expand the staffing capacity of your library.

**Places** can be physical, like a large building, or structural like a park or an open field. Schools, hospitals, even empty and unused spaces can be community assets. These places can help to expand the physical capacity of your library.

**Services** are assets that help to improve the quality of life for your community. They can be as simple as bus routes and other public transportation, or as complex as cultural organizations or childhood development centers. These services can often supplement and expand your library’s capacity in partnerships and outreach services.

**Businesses** can be large businesses like coffee chains or technology developers, or small businesses that are locally owned and operated. When thinking about the businesses in your community, it is important to think even as small as businesses like food trucks or ones that might be operating out of a community member’s garage. Every business has the opportunity to support your library and your community. Businesses often supplement a variety of capacities, including technology, space, partnerships, and staffing.
